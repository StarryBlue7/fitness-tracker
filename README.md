# Fitness Tracker

This is a fitness tracker app that allows for recording daily exercise routines. A user can create a new workout, then add data for any combination of resistance and cardio training exercises.

This data can then be visualized on the dashboard via various charts displaying the user's aggregated exercise totals for workout durations, total weight lifted, etc. over the past seven days.
